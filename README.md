# JavaScript-Practice

### JavaScript assignments and notes.

JavaScript related things that I have from the course I completed. Please note, my code may contain errors, may use bad styling, or may not even be finished and most of the comments have been scrubbed from the files. You shouldn't use this code at all for any purpose whatsoever. Some snippets of code here are notes and not mine and if you would like the code removed, please message me, open a request, etc. and I will do so.
